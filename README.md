The objective of this project is to provide learning activities for medium-low spectrum autistic children. Children with other disabilities might benefit from it as well. 

Working with such autistic children we identified a gap of software, where educational software normally requires skills that these children should acquire. The activities provided by this project are aimed at helping these children to acquire these skills.

We made the source of this project public to allow serving the application from git-pages at least for a pilot period. We still keep our complete rights and ownership of this code reserved.
